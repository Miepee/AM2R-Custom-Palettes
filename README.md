# AM2R-Custom-Palettes
A GitHub repository hosting custom palettes concerning a particular fangame.

If you want to contribute your palettes, you can just open an issue and fill out the form that is provided.
Alternatively, you can also post in the [AM2R Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YTQnkAJ).

# Using the Palettes from here for AM2R
Download a palette of your choice and rename it to the suit it replaces and move it to `Launcher/Profiles/Community Updates (Latest)/mods/palettes/suits`. Example, `varia (Ice Suit).png` gets renamed to just `varia.png`. Then, boot the game up and it should work. The same applies for `MorphTrailColors` and `SpiderBallGlow`, just rename the file to specifically what suit it's for, and it should work.
If you encounter any problems, you can join the [AM2R Discord](https://discord.gg/YTQnkAJ) and ask there in `#am2r-custom`.

# Easy Editing Guide
If you want a very quick an easy way to create custom palettes yourself, Electrix has made a webpage that makes the process ridiculously simple!  
Just visit this website here: https://electrixcodes.github.io/AM2RSuitEditor/

# Manual Editing Guide
This is a small guide on how to edit palettes manually, without using Electrix' Site.
This will work on Windows and Linux. Apologies for Android users as you're locked out from touching these things. Your only option is to do this on a desktop and then create an APK again.  
Note for Linux users: in order to actually have access to the files, extract the AppImage with the following command: `AM2R.AppImage --appimage-extract`.

## The Tools
First up is the tool you wanna use. An Image editor with the ability to edit indexed images is preferred, but not required. Any Image Editor works. Nonetheless, popping an @ to me in the discord server (Specifically, the #am2r_custom channel because we like to keep things in their relevant channels!) should get a response in a fairly quick manner, otherwise I'm sure others are just as helpful.

## Backing up the original files
This is optional, but highly recommended in case something goes wrong and you want to revert to the original palettes. These are located specifically for the Launcher, within `Launcher/Profiles/Community Updates (Latest)/mods/palettes/suits`. You should copy the original files by selecting them all and just, copy/paste or putting them in a Backups Folder.

## Screencaps to save time
This is optional as well, but it's to make life easier down the line. Especially in the event you don't quite know where a color goes, and want to do a color lookup. Some frames in the idle animations facing either side, morphball turning, and standing on a save point make for great angles to work with for specific colors. You can do this in-game by pressing F12 (Note for Linux users: Creating screenshots in-game doesn't work currently).
Keep in mind that the current Launcher version (1.2) has a bug with taking screenshots in that, it'll take the first one just fine creating `snap 0000.png`, but subsequent screenshots will ***overwrite*** the `snap 0000.png` file. To circumvent this, start the game manually through `Profiles/Community Updates (Latest)/AM2R.exe`, or just move/rename the `snap 0000.png` as you take them one at a time. The screenshots can be found in `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\AM2R`.

## Editing palettes
If you have the option to use indexed images, load up the palette and a cut-out Samus from a screenshot and edit the palette directly. If not, just change the colors in the **right** row, not the left one.
If you want to see how your current palette looks or want to see what a certain pixel is for, save the file and reboot AM2R again.

## Troubleshooting
Sometimes, the edit you make doesn't work. This happens. Some tools just don't collaborate sometimes for whatever reason. If you ever encounter any problems with software or palettes not working, feel free to join the Discord linked above and ask questions there.
